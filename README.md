The Purpose of the Application
In the interest of gaining more knowledge upon studies we have a good variation of resources which might be Quiz apps which quizzes your knowledge of what you desire to know.
They practically test your knowledge on what you might have studied to help the user remember what they know. (Baxter, Courage, and Caine, 2015.)
But with this app, it tests your knowledge on history questions which happen all around the world which might come to mind knowing your surroundings. The main objective of this app is to ensure the user gains more knowledge on the history of the world where it should not be forgotten but cherished. 
 
Design Considerations 
User-center design, which means that clear layout must be considered for it to be user friendly whereas to be simple and readable. The first step is to identify the target audience, whether it’s students.
From the layout and design to the tone of the content, maintaining a consistent approach across the entire app helps users feel comfortable and familiar with how it works (Hoang, M., 2024). The functionality should be consistent in a way where it should show you different questions in an order. Tone and language consistency are just as important (Hawkins, 2014). Whether you’re aiming for a casual, friendly voice or a more formal educational tone, sticking to the same style across the app helps users feel like they’re experiencing a cohesive environment.
Proper placement of content, buttons, and interactive elements helps users navigate the app intuitively, enhances the overall aesthetic, and encourages continued engagement (Ayada, and Hammad, 2023). Made sure that buttons are large enough to tap comfortably, text is legible with high contrast, and content is structured in a way that can be easily navigated with screen readers.
